Hi! I'm Ted. I'm a certified* rocket surgeon, amongst other things.


I like to make games! You can see a few in my [Projects page](/projects).


Sometimes I make stuff out of wood and sell it!
You can check out [Firewater Fabrication](https://instagram.com/firewaterfabrication\) for that.


Eventually I might start blogging at [Department of Rocket Surgery](https://www.departmentofrocketsurgery.com), but who knows?


Sometimes I take contract work for Unity development and game design. If you're interested, send an email to `hi at tedaronson dot com`.


If you'd like to read my resume, [here it is](/assets/resume.pdf)


And if you're wondering how I got my rocket surgery certification, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tedw4rd) or Discord @ tedw4rd#6835
