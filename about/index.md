I'm a game designer, a programmer, and certified rocket surgeon. I like making things and making people happy. I particularly like making games for health and education. In my spare time, I box, geek out about space stuff, and occasionally make pretty excellent pork ribs.

If you're here to check out some of the software tools I've developed, welcome! You can check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/tedw4rd), or head over to the [Projects section](/projects).

If you're here to read about the games I've made, you can also find them in the [Projects section](/projects). I've also set aside a few that I particularly like and put them in [my Portfolio](/portfolio).

If you'd like to read some of my blatherings about programming, game design, science, and whatever else I talk about, I may eventually put some content in [the Blog](/posts).

If you'd like to read my resume, [here it is](/assets/resume.pdf)

If you'd like to contact me about contract work (I occasionally take game design and Unity development contracts), hit me up at hi @ tedaronson dot com.

And if you're wondering how I got my rocket surgery certification, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tedw4rd) or Discord @ tedw4rd#6835
