I've been cleaning house a bunch recently. A lot has been going on in my life as of late, and there are still a few more changes left to come. It feels appropriate to make some changes to what I do online to go along with my offline life-adjustments.

I've never been really thrilled with the old Wordpress version of *tedaronson.com*, so I decided to get rid of it. Welcome to the new hotness! I used to be hosted on Bluehost, which was good and cheap for a while, but the quality of their servers felt a little lacking. Maybe it was because I was running Wordpress (which is a pretty chunky piece of software), but I hated how slowly each page would load. Plus, I wasn't really using much of the extra features I got through Bluehost (like email and simple file storage), so it all felt kind of wasteful at $12/month.

Enter Github Pages, which is where you're reading this now. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service offered by Github that allows you to host static websites on their servers, as long as the pages and content are part of a Github repository. You can do a lot with this. A lot of big open source projects that host their code on Github (like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Adobe Open Source](https://adobe.github.io/)) use Github Pages for the project's main site. You can host any static content you can create, but Github Pages also can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to help generate static content from templates (which is what I do). You can see the source for this website at [https://github.com/tedw4rd/tedw4rd.github.io]

While I'm shilling for Github Pages, I should also mention the other hosting provider I work with. [Gandi](https://gandi.net) is an awesome hosting company that very much values privacy and service. They're not as noobie friendly as something like Bluehost, but they have excellent products. I've used them as my domain provider for a couple of years, and they also host several of my other projects. I can't recommend them enough.
